			<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p>My name is Dylan Woodrow-Thorne and ever since i was little i have wanted to work within the Gaming industry, more specifically <br>
				a game designer. In order to achieve this goal i have made various desicions throughout my academic years to put me further <br>
				towards this career.</p>
			<h2> Personal Statement: </h2>
				<p> When trying to decide on which A-levels I wanted to study, I really struggled as I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
				yet there was always a part of me that wanted to work in the gaming industry. This is what lead to me enrolling in my current <br>
				college course where I study creative media and gaming, which then revealed to me my dream job, a game designer. This is <br>
				why I want to enrol into to university to study game design so that I may one day see my name in the credits of a game. <br>
				Gaming has always been one of my passions ever since I turned on my brotherâ€™s Nintendo GameCube when I was 10.But <br>
				more than just enjoying the act of playing the games I always wondered why they were fun, how they worked and why certain <br>
				games were better than others. This then led me to playing and analysing more and more games until I had un understanding <br>
				of the sheer scale of the industry and how games can come in an almost endless amount of different styles or genres. From <br>
				story driven games that offer player choice but lack certain gameplay elements, to simple puzzle games that have only one or <br>
				two objectives for the player, yet they get played for hours and hours due to their replay value. With this knowledge I feel that I <br>
				will be a perfect addition to the industry, as I can also bring to the table a large number of different plans and ideas that will <br> 
				work. The only thing I am lacking is the knowledge on how to actually work in this industry, hence why I wish to study game <br>
				design at university. At college I have learned and practised how to compose a GDD (Game Design Document) which is a <br>
				large document that contains all of the information and details about a game that you plan to make. This is a necessary skill <br>
				for a game designer, as they need to be able to present their ideas to the whole development team in a clear way. At college, <br>
				I have also had to study and describe a large number of different factors to the gaming industry, including defining the industry <br>
				as a whole.</p>
